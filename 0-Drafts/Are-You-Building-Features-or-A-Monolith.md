# Are You Building Features or A Monolith? (Architect In Slices Not Layers)

The problem with layered architecture is that we don’t know all domain objects up front. Let’s be honest. When was the last time you were on a project for a customer who knew exactly what they wanted from the beginning? With Agile approaches, it may take several sprints before you finish parts of the domain. An alternative architecture approach to layers is slices. Slices allow you to focus on delivering independent features.
