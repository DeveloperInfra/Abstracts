# An Affair to Remember

We are not talking about a classic movie. We are also not talking about wedding planning. A panel of "experts" will gather to discuss the secrets of successful developer events. There's much you can learn for your next memorable event from an intimate meetup of a few to a conference like CodeStock of hundreds. Join us and as we share what we have learned as well as opportunities for you in the future.
