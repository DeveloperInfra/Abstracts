You can build Windows Store Apps with the JavaScript with HTML5 and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) template, and reuse your existing jQuery skills and code. But should you? How is an app different from a website? In this session, Iâ€™ll answer these questions and also share some best tips and pragmatic advice for using jQuery in Windows Store apps.

### Inspiration:
* This talk is heavily inspired by the talk Jaime Rodriguez, Microsoft Windows Evangelist, and Mike Hosteler, appendTo Founder & CEO, gave on November 2, 2012 on the fourth and last day of the Build conference titled [Writing Windows Store apps with jQuery](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/3-130). In my opinion, this should have been announced in the keynote!
