# Attack of Virtual Machines and Websites

One day we woke up and our industry was under attack! The battle line drawn with IT departments on one side and the Cloud on the other. No longer did we as developers have to wait weeks for infrastructure needed for our next project. Suddenly we could have everything we could dream of in mere seconds.

Join Mark as he shows you a practical, no-BS intro to Azure from the perspective of a web developer. With the ability to run both Windows and Linux, you can deploy websites in .NET, Node.js, Java, PHP, Python and more. Push with Git, fire up a thousand VMs, and do it all from the command line. It's a whole new game and a whole new Cloud.
